# Python Snake Game

This is a classic snake game built in Python using the Turtle graphics module. The objective of the game is to guide the snake to eat food, grow in length, and avoid colliding with the walls or its own tail. The game becomes progressively harder as the snake grows longer and the speed increases.

## Getting Started

To get started with the game, follow these steps:

Install Python if you don't have it already. You can download it from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Clone the repository to your local machine using: 

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-snake-game.git.`

Navigate to the project directory using the command line.

`cd Snake-Game `

Run the command 

`python main.py `

## Features

- Snake movement using arrow keys
- Food generated randomly on the screen
- Score display on screen
- Game speed adjustment
- Game over message when the snake hits the walls or its own body

- `SPEED`: The speed of the snake movement (default: 0.1).
- `FOOD_SIZE`: The size of the food on the screen (default: 10).
- `SCREEN_WIDTH`: The width of the game screen (default: 600).
- `SCREEN_HEIGHT`: The height of the game screen (default: 600).
- `FONT_SIZE`: The font size for the score display (default: 24).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Turtle graphics module

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the classic snake game that was popularized in the 90s.

The Turtle graphics module was used to create the game interface and handle user input.
